 [1] "                Rated                                 Had lunch at Reds on an extremely hot day.  Too hot to sit on the patio even.  The place is huge.  At the corner of Gerrard and Yonge.  My friend ordered the thai lettuce wraps and i ordered the butter chicken bowl but it was more of a spicy curry bowl served with rice and naan bread wedges.  It was pretty spicy so i couldn't finish the whole thing.  It was ok.  Not great.  My friend said her dish was spicy too.  Service was great.  I am not sure what their best dish is because their menu was all over the map trying to have something for everyone.  Probably go i d for a group of people.                                                 starvingfoodie.blogspot.com                                            "

It was not real busy ordered drinks which came right away .I'm always looking for a good burger so l tried the cheese burger .for not being to busy it took forever to get are food.One sml bowl of frys & a very dry hamburger so dry every bite I took it fell apart in the plate.the service was good but it seems more of high end place to be called a Tavern. I'd give it a 5 out of 10.

 [3] "                Rated                 A very nice establishment! We went as a farewell lunch for a coworker, and we all enjoyed the meal. It was pretty quiet at the start of our meal (11:45ish) but the place was really hopping at the end (12:30ish).Food: I had the truffle fries and only that, so I can't comment too much on the food except that the portion was decent for an app and they were absolutely delicious! Service: Our server was very good and kinda flirty, which was fine but maybe would have gone over better with a different audience. But we received our food quickly, there were no mistakes, the bills came quickly too, and the overall atmosphere was friendly.Price: The prices are $2-3 more than the average place, but the prices were nonetheless very reasonable for the food portions and the establishment is well maintained and has comfortable seating, so you pay for quality and comfort.Summary: A nice establishment for a nice, classy lunch! We enjoyed ourselves and it is the favourite location of the girl we were saying farewell to, so it was a great choice for our group. Definitely recommended!!                                            "

I have eaten there three times so far and each time I have been so disappointed. At this point I have vowed never to return, even for work events or birthdays. It is awful. Some of the appetizers could be called okay but all of the main courses are to be avoided. A good place for outdoor drinks only.

The food was delicious, the beer and wine menu interesting,  and the servers knowledgeable.   It looks,  at first,  a little dark and intimidating,  but the ambiance is intimate and makes for a cozy upscale pub experience.

My friend ordered the thai lettuce wraps and i ordered the butter chicken bowl but it was more of a spicy curry bowl served with rice and naan bread wedges.  It was pretty spicy so i couldn't finish the whole thing.  It was ok.  Not great.  My friend said her dish was spicy too.  Service was great.  I am not sure what their best dish is because their menu was all over the map trying to have something for everyone.  Probably go i d for a group of people.                                                 starvingfoodie.blogspot.com                                            "

It was not real busy ordered drinks which came right away .I'm always looking for a good burger so l tried the cheese burger .for not being to busy it took forever to get are food.One sml bowl of frys & a very dry hamburger so dry every bite I took it fell apart in the plate.the service was good but it seems more of high end place to be called a Tavern.

 [3] "                 A very nice establishment! We went as a farewell lunch for a coworker, and we all enjoyed the meal. It was pretty quiet at the start of our meal (11:45ish) but the place was really hopping at the end (12:30ish).Food: I had the truffle fries and only that, so I can't comment too much on the food except that the portion was decent for an app and they were absolutely delicious! Service: Our server was very good and kinda flirty, which was fine but maybe would have gone over better with a different audience. But we received our food quickly, there were no mistakes, the bills came quickly too, and the overall atmosphere was friendly.Price: The prices are $2-3 more than the average place, but the prices were nonetheless very reasonable for the food portions and the establishment is well maintained and has comfortable seating, so you pay for quality and comfort.Summary: A nice establishment for a nice, classy lunch! We enjoyed ourselves and it is the favourite location of the girl we were saying farewell to, so it was a great choice for our group. Definitely recommended!!                                            "

The \"loaded\" baked potato was dry and in need of more toppings. The flourless chocolate cake was ok but would have been better without the sea salt.

[10] "                                 My husband and I visited red's and had a great meal.   The food was delicious, the beer and wine menu interesting,  and the servers knowledgeable.   It looks,  at first,  a little dark and intimidating,  but the ambiance is intimate and makes for a cozy upscale pub experience.
